# Privacy Policy for Mobbin Reliability Score

**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026

## 1. Introduction
**Mobbin Reliability Score** We values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles information when you use our service.

**In short:** We do not collect, store, or share your personal data. The extension runs locally on your device and only processes public data required to display app reliability scores.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### Personal Information
We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, location, or IP address. We do not use cookies or tracking pixels.

### Web Content & Page Interaction
The extension accesses the content of the web pages you visit on **Mobbin.com** for the sole purpose of:
1.  Identifying the name of the mobile application you are viewing.
2.  Extracting public metadata (like app category or developer name) to improve search accuracy.

This information is processed temporarily in your browser's memory and is **not** transmitted to any private servers managed by us.

### External Data Fetching
To calculate the Reliability Score, the extension sends search queries using the app name found on Mobbin to public third-party store fronts:
-   **Google Play Store**
-   **Apple App Store**

These requests are made directly from your browser to these services. The extension does not send your browsing history to these services, only the specific search query for the app you are viewing.

## 3. Data Storage
The extension uses your browser's **Local Storage** (`chrome.storage.local`) to cache reliability scores. This is done solely to improve performance and reduce the number of network requests. This data stays on your device and is not shared with anyone.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The extension interacts with the following third-party services to fetch public app data:
-   Google Play Store
-   Apple App Store

Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on how they handle search queries.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
